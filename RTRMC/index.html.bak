      Completion</title>

    <h1>RTRMC : Low-rank matrix completion via preconditioned optimization on
      the Grassmann manifold</h1>
    RTRMC is an algorithm developed by <a href="http://perso.uclouvain.be/nicolas.boumal/">Nicolas
      Boumal</a> (contact person) and <a href="http://www.inma.ucl.ac.be/%7Eabsil/">Pierre-Antoine
      Absil</a> at <a href="http://www.uclouvain.be">UCLouvain</a> to solve
    low-rank matrix completion problems.<br>
    <br>
    The associated paper is available here:<br>

    <strong>This version includes a preconditioner for RTRMC and adds Riemannian
      conjugate gradients support, thanks to the </strong><strong><a href="http://www.manopt.org">Manopt</a></strong><strong>
      toolbox.</strong><strong><br>
      As a consequence, the code changed significantly: please see below to
      download version 3.2 of RTRMC and RCGMC (released July 22, 2015).<br>
    </strong>This version of the algorithms is also described in <a href="../papers/boumal_optimization_and_estimation_on_manifolds_phd_thesis.htm">Nicolas

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td style="text-align: justify;">We address the numerical problem of <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">recovering large matrices of low rank
              when most of the entries are unknown</span>. We exploit the <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">geometry of the low-rank constraint</span>
            to recast the problem as an unconstrained optimization problem on a
            single Grassmann manifold. We then apply second-order Riemannian
            trust-region methods (RTRMC 2) and Riemannian conjugate gradient
            methods (RCGMC) to solve it. A <span style="font-weight: bold;">preconditioner
              for the Hessian</span> is introduced that helps control the
            conditioning of the problem and we detail preconditioned versions of
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Riemannian optimization</span>
            algorithms. The cost of each iteration is linear in the number of
            known entries. The proposed methods are competitive with
            state-of-the-art algorithms on a wide range of problem instances. In
            particular, they <span style="font-weight: bold;">perform well on
              rectangular matrices</span>. We further note that second-order and
            preconditioned methods are <span style="font-weight: bold;">well
              suited to solve badly conditioned matrix completion tasks</span>.</td>

    Here is the <a href="rtrmc_v32_download.htm">Matlab code for RTRMC v3.2</a>
    under <a href="licence.txt">BSD licence</a>.<br>
    This version of the code was put online on July 22, 2015. It changed
    significantly since version 1.1 and now uses <a href="http://www.manopt.org">Manopt 2.0</a>.<br>
    Changes since version 2: now bundled with Manopt 1.0.5 instead of 1.0.4, and
    the buildproblem function now allows the data I, J, X, C to be given in any
    order.<br>
    Changes since version 3: a bug prevented the code from working <span style="font-weight: bold;">when
      the weights <em>C</em><sub>ij</sub> were not all the same</span>. This
    was corrected by patching spbuildmatrix.c. And moved to Manopt 2.0.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">To install and use the software:</span>
    <ul>
      <li>Unzip the archive on your disk and launch the script <span style="font-style: italic;">main.m</span>.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If this works, you're done.</li>
        <li>If this fails, then the C-Mex codes probably need to be compiled for
          your platform:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Edit the script <span style="font-style: italic;">installrtrmc.m</span>
            and set the flag&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">I_launched_main_and_it_failed</span>
            to true.</li>
          <li>Launch the script <span style="font-style: italic;">installrtrmc.m</span>.</li>
          <li>Launch the script <span style="font-style: italic;">main.m</span>
            once again.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <li>Use the functions in <span style="font-style: italic;">buildproblem.m</span>,
        <span style="font-style: italic;">initialguess.m</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">rtrmc.m</span>
        as shown in <span style="font-style: italic;">main.m</span> to apply
        RTRMC to your problem instances.</li>
      <li>Ideally, download the latest version of <a href="http://www.manopt.org">Manopt</a>,
        to be used instead of the version bundled in the zip-file above.</li>
    </ul>

            fails (quite probably somewhere in the <span style="font-style: italic;">installrtrmc.m</span>
            script), then either there is trouble with the C compiler Matlab
            tries to use, which you can check by typing 'mex -setup' at the
            Matlab prompt, or the installation script is incompatible with your
            OS (it was written for Windows users, but has been found to work as
            is on a MacOS and a Linux computer).<span style="font-weight: bold;">

    then try to raise the value of lambda (the regularization parameter). This
    error triggers when the least-squares problem (the computation of W<sub>U</sub>)
    does not have a unique solution, so that one of the diagonal blocks of the
    large matrix A does not have a proper Cholesky factorization.<br>
