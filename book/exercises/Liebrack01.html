    The Lie bracket is nonzero
</title>

<p>
The Lie bracket $[U, V]f = U(V f) - V(U f)$ involves taking two derivatives. In $\reals^d$, we are used to the fact that partial derivatives commute: $\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_2 \partial x_1}$. So on $\reals^d$ one might expect that the Lie bracket is always zero. Below you show this is not the case, even in Euclidean space.

<question>
    For $\calM = \reals^2$, consider the vector fields $U(x) = (1,0)$, $V(x) = (0, x_1 x_2)$, and the function $f(x) = x_2$. Show that $[U, V] f = f$.

<answer>
    We have that for $x \in \reals^2$ that
            \begin{aligned}
                U f(x) = Df(x)[U(x)] = \langle (0,1), (1,0) \rangle = 0.
            \end{aligned}
            Further,
            \begin{aligned}
                V f(x) = Df(x)[V(x)] = x_1x_2
            \end{aligned}
            and thus
            \begin{aligned}
                U (Vf)(x) = D(Vf)(x)[U(x)] = \langle (x_2,x_1), (1,0) \rangle = f(x).
            \end{aligned}
            We conclude that
            \begin{aligned}
            ~[U,V] f(x) = U(V f)(x) - V(U f)(x) = U (V f)(x) = f(x).
            \end{aligned}
