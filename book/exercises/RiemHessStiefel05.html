    Riemannian Hessian on Stiefel
</title>
    
<p>
For $p \leq n$, consider the Stiefel manifold
\begin{aligned}
    \calM = \Stnp = \{X \in \Rnp \colon X^\top X = I_p\}.
\end{aligned}
as an embedded submanifold of $\calE = \Rnp$. We consider $\calM$ as a Riemannian submanifold of $\Rnp$, endowed with usual the inner product $\inner{X}{Y} = \trace(X^\top Y)$. In the exercise <a exercise="RGDStiefel04">RGD on Stiefel</a>, you showed orthogonal projection to $\T_X\calM$ is given by
\begin{aligned}
    \Proj_{X} \colon \calE \to \T_X\calM, \quad \quad \Proj_X(U) = U - \frac{1}{2}X (X^\top U + U^\top X) = U - X \symm(X^\top U).
\end{aligned}
Let $f \colon \calM \to \reals$ be smooth, and let $\overline f$ be a smooth extension of $f$.

    Define the map $\overline G$ by
            \begin{aligned}
                X \in \Stnp \mapsto \grad \overline f(X) - X \symm(X^\top \grad \overline f(X)).
            \end{aligned}
            Then, as for $X \in \Stnp$ we have
            \begin{aligned}
                \Proj_X(\nabla \overline f(X)) = \grad \overline f(X) - X \symm(X^\top \grad \overline f(X)),
            \end{aligned}
            $\overline G$ is a smooth extension of $\grad f$. Therefore, $\Hess f(X)[U] = \Proj_X(\D \overline G(X)[U])$ for $(X,U) \in \T \calM$. Differentiating, we get by the product rule
            \begin{aligned}
            \D \overline G(X)[U] &= \Hess \overline{f}(X)[U] - \frac{1}{2} U \symm(X^\top \nabla \overline f(X)) - X \symm(U^\top \grad \overline{f}(X) + X^\top \Hess \overline{f}(X)[U])
            \end{aligned}
            for $(X,U) \in \T \calM$. Therefore, we get the "ehess2rhess" formula
            \begin{aligned}
                \Hess f(X)[U] &= \Proj_X(\D \overline G(X)[U]) \\
                &= \Proj_X(\Hess \overline f(X)[U]) - \Proj_X (U \symm(X^\top \grad \overline f(X)))
            \end{aligned}
            for $(X,U) \in \T \calM$. In the above we used that for $S \in \reals^{p \times p}$ symmetric it holds that
            \begin{aligned}
                \Proj_X(X S) = X S - X \symm(X^\top X S) = X (S - \symm(S)) = 0.
            \end{aligned}

Let $\Retr$ be a retraction on Stiefel (e.g., QR or polar retraction).
Let $(X, U) \in \T \calM$. Example 5.32 of the course textbook shows that the Hessian $\Hess f(X)[U]$ in direction $U$ can be approximated as
\begin{aligned}
\Hess f(X)[U] \approx \frac{1}{\overline t}(\Proj_X(\grad f(\Retr_X(\overline t U))) - \grad f(X)),
\end{aligned}
where the approximation becomes better as $\overline t > 0$ approaches zero. This is a finite difference approximation of the Riemannian Hessian (when $\calM$ is a Riemannian submanifold).

<question>
    For the particular cost function
        \begin{aligned}
            f(X) = \trace(X^\top A X), \quad \quad A \in \Rnn \text{ with } A^\top = A,
        \end{aligned}
        write down a formula for the Riemannian Hessian of $f$, and a formula for the its finite difference approximation. Implement both formulae, and compare them for different values of $\overline t$ (e.g., try $\overline t = 10^{-1}, 10^{-2}, 10^{-4},10^{-8}$).

    Define $\overline{f}(X) = \trace(X^\top A X)$ for all $X \in \reals^{n \times p}$. This map is obviously a smooth extension of $f$. Now, for $(X,U) \in \T \calM$ we have that
        \begin{aligned}
            \grad \overline f(X) = 2 A X, \quad\quad \Hess \overline f(X)[U] = 2 A U.
        \end{aligned}
        Therefore, $\Hess f(X)[U] = 2 \Proj_X(A U) - \Proj_X(U X^\top A X).$
        For the finite different approximation we just need the Riemannian gradient of $f$, which we already computed for the exercise <a exercise="RGDStiefel04">RGD on Stiefel</a>. The Riemannian gradient of $f$ is given by
        \begin{aligned}
            \grad f(X) = 2 (I_n - XX^\top)AX.
        \end{aligned}
