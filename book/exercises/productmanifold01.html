<question>
    Show that a product of embedded submanifolds is an embedded submanifold. How are the tangent spaces of the product manifold related to the tangent spaces of the base manifolds?

    Recall the definition of embedded submanifold and different make distinctions of all three possible cases.

    Let the embedded submanifolds be $\calM \subset \calE$ and $\calM' \subset \calE'$.
        Observe that the case $\calM$ and $\calM'$ are both open subsets is trivial as $\calM \times \calM'$ is again an open set. Further, the case that one of them is open and the other one isn't is also straightforward by considering
        \begin{aligned}
            H \colon U \times \calM' \to \reals^{k}, \quad H(x, x') = h(x),
        \end{aligned}
        where $h:U \to \reals^{k}$ is the local defining function for $x \in \calM$.
    </p>

        Let us consider the case where neither $\calM$ nor $\calM'$ is an open embedded submanifold. So both $\calM$ and $\calM'$ strictly lower dimensional manifolds.
        Take $x\in \calM, x' \in \calM'$ with corresponding local defining functions
        \begin{aligned}
            h \colon U \to \reals^k, \quad h' \colon U' \to \reals^{k'}.
        \end{aligned}
        Define
        \begin{aligned}
            H \colon U \times U' \to \reals^{k + k'}, \quad H(x, x') = (h(x), h'(x')).
        \end{aligned}
        We claim $H$ is a local defining function for $\calM \times \calM'$.  Indeed, $U \times U' \cap \calM \times \calM' = (U \cap \calM) \times (U' \cap \calM') = h^{-1}(\{0\}) \times (h')^{-1}(\{0\}) = H^{-1}(\{0\})$.
    </p>
    <p>
        Moreover, for $(x, x') \in \calM \times \calM'$ we know
        \begin{aligned}
            &\D H(x, x') \colon \calE \times \calE' \to \reals^{k + k'}, \\
            &\D H(x, x')[(v, v')] = (\D h(x)[v], \D h'(x')[v']) = \D h(x)[v] \times \D h'(x')[v'] \in \reals^k \times \reals^{k'},
        \end{aligned}
        which is clearly surjective and thus of full rank as $\D h(x)$ and $\D h'(x')$ are surjective.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, we have that
        \begin{aligned}
            \T_{(x, x')} \calM \times \calM' = \ker \D H(x, x') = \ker \D h(x) \times \ker \D h'(x') = \T_x \calM \times \T_{x'} \calM'.
        \end{aligned}
        Observe that also in the case that one of the manifolds is a open set we have that $\T_{(x, x')} \calM \times \calM' = \T_x \calM \times \T_{x'} \calM'$, giving that this characterisation always holds.
