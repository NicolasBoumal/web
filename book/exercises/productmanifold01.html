    Product manifolds
</title>

Let $\calM$ be an embedded submanifold of a linear space $\calE$.
Likewise, let $\calM'$ be an embedded submanifold of a (possibly different) linear space $\calE'$.

<question>
    Show that the product $\calM \times \calM'$ is an embedded submanifold of $\calE \times \calE'$.
</question>
<sketch>
    Recall the definition of embedded submanifold. It's useful to distinguish cases depending on whether $\calM$ is or is not open in $\calE$ (and likewise for $\calM'$).

    Let the embedded submanifolds be $\calM \subset \calE$ and $\calM' \subset \calE'$.
        Observe that the case $\calM$ and $\calM'$ are both open subsets is trivial as $\calM \times \calM'$ is again an open set. Further, the case that one of them is open and the other one isn't is also straightforward by considering
        \begin{aligned}
            H \colon U \times \calM' \to \reals^{k}, \quad H(x, x') = h(x),
        \end{aligned}
        where $h:U \to \reals^{k}$ is the local defining function for $x \in \calM$.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let us consider the case where neither $\calM$ nor $\calM'$ is an open embedded submanifold. So both $\calM$ and $\calM'$ strictly lower dimensional manifolds.
        Take $x\in \calM, x' \in \calM'$ with corresponding local defining functions
        \begin{aligned}
            h \colon U \to \reals^k, \quad h' \colon U' \to \reals^{k'}.
        \end{aligned}
        Define
        \begin{aligned}
            H \colon U \times U' \to \reals^{k + k'}, \quad H(x, x') = (h(x), h'(x')).
        \end{aligned}
        We claim $H$ is a local defining function for $\calM \times \calM'$.  Indeed, $U \times U' \cap \calM \times \calM' = (U \cap \calM) \times (U' \cap \calM') = h^{-1}(\{0\}) \times (h')^{-1}(\{0\}) = H^{-1}(\{0\})$.
    </p>
    <p>
        Moreover, for $(x, x') \in \calM \times \calM'$ we know
        \begin{aligned}
            &\D H(x, x') \colon \calE \times \calE' \to \reals^{k + k'}, \\
            &\D H(x, x')[(v, v')] = (\D h(x)[v], \D h'(x')[v']) = \D h(x)[v] \times \D h'(x')[v'] \in \reals^k \times \reals^{k'},
        \end{aligned}
        which is clearly surjective and thus of full rank as $\D h(x)$ and $\D h'(x')$ are surjective.

<question>
    How are the tangent spaces of the product manifold related to the tangent spaces of the base manifolds?
</question>
<sketch>
    Once you have a proof for the previous question, this one should follow fairly directly (recall the various characterizations we have for the tangent spaces).
</sketch>
<answer>
    Continue from the previous question for the case where neither $\calM$ nor $\calM'$ are open.
    We have a local defining function $H$, from which we see
    \begin{aligned}
        \T_{(x, x')} (\calM \times \calM') = \ker \D H(x, x') = \ker \D h(x) \times \ker \D h'(x') = \T_x \calM \times \T_{x'} \calM'.
    \end{aligned}
    In the case that one of the manifolds is open, we also have that
    \begin{aligned}
        \T_{(x, x')} (\calM \times \calM') = \T_x \calM \times \T_{x'} \calM'.
    \end{aligned}
    Make sure you see why.

Notice that this exercise immediately implies that a product of any (finite) number of embedded submanifolds is itself an embedded submanifold.
Likewise, if $\calM$ is an embedded submanifold of $\calE$, then $\calM^n$ (the set of $n$-tuples of elements of $\calM$) is an embedded submanifold of $\calE^n$.
