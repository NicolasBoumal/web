    The sphere is a manifold
</title>

<p>
    Have a look at the formal definition of embedded submanifolds in the reference book (Definition 3.10), then consider the following questions.
</p>

<question>
    Give a (set of ?) local defining function(s) $h$ for the sphere $\Sd$. Pay particular attention to checking the rank condition on the differential of $h$.
</question>
<sketch>
    How can you algebraically characterise points on the sphere ?
</sketch>
<answer>
    Take $h(x) = x^Tx-1$ and note $\D h(x)[v] = 2 \cdot x^\top v$. We omit the details showing that this is a local defining function as this is just a simple straightforward verification.
</answer>

<question>
    Get an expression for the tangent spaces of $\Sd$.
</question>
<sketch>
    How did we define tangent spaces ? What characterisation did we show ?
</sketch>
<answer>
    We saw for $x \in \Sd$ the tangent space is given by $\T_x \Sd = \ker (\D h(x))$. Thus we have that
    \begin{aligned}
        \T_x \Sd = \text{span}(x)^{\perp} = \{x \in \reals^d \; | \; \langle x,v \rangle = 0\}.
    \end{aligned}
</answer>
