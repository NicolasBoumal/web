<title>The sphere is a manifold</title>
<p>
	Have a look at the formal definition of embedded submanifolds in the reference book (Chapter 3), then consider the following questions.
</p>
<question>Give a (set of?) local defining function(s) $h$ for the sphere $\Sd$. Pay particular attention to checking the rank condition on the differential of $h$.</question>
<question>Get an expression for the tangent spaces of $\Sd$ by looking at the kernels of the differentials of $h$.</question>
<answer>
	Take $h(x) = x^T x-1$ and note $\D h(x)[v] = x^T v$.  We omit the details showing that this is a local defining function.
