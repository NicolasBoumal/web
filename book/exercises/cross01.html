    The cross is not a manifold
</title>

<question>
    Show that the cross $\mathcal{X} = \{x \in \reals^2 : x_1^2 = x_2^2\}$ is not an embedded submanifold.
    <hint>
        It is not sufficient to show that $x \mapsto x_1^2 - x_2^2$ is not a local defining function at the origin. It is necessary to show that no local definition function exists at that point.

    Proceeding by contradiction, assume that $\mathcal{X}$ is a smooth manifold.
    Analyze the tangent space of the origin.

    <p>
    Suppose for contradiction that $\mathcal{X}$ is a manifold.
    Then, it must have a dimension: either 0, 1 or 2.
    The only way a submanifold of $\reals^2$ can have dimension 2 is if it is an open subset of $\reals^2$.
    Clearly, $\mathcal{X}$ is not open.
    Thus, if it is a manifold, its dimension must be 0 or 1.
    Let's derive a contradiction to this.
    </p>
    <p>
    Define $\gamma_1 \colon \reals \to \mathcal{X}$ by $t \mapsto t \cdot v_1$ and $\gamma_2 \colon \reals \to \mathcal{X}$ by $t \mapsto t \cdot v_2$ with $v_1 = (1, 1)$ and $v_2 = (1, -1)$.
    These curves are clearly well defined and smooth thus by the definition of tangent space we have that $v_i = \gamma_i'(0)$ is in $\T_{(0,0)} \mathcal{X}$ for $i = 1, 2$.
    </p>
    <p>
    But then we have that $\dim(\T_{(0,0)} \mathcal{X}) \geq 2$ (in fact, equals 2), which is in contradiction with $\dim(\T_{(0,0)} \mathcal{X}) = \dim(\mathcal{X}) \in \{0,1\}$.
