Found a way (not great, but better). Writing a coarse summary here for my own reference:

Download wktohtml: https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html
Save the webpage you want to convert to a file (so that all the javascripts have been executed etc.)
Run wktohtml on that webpage, through a local web server (so it can access css/javascript on CDNs):
wkhtmltopdf http://localhost:8000/book/exercises/convert2pdf/savedpage.html --no-stop-slow-scripts output.pdf

It sort of works, but the math comes out too small (attached example). Also, would need some tweaks to make solutions appear.
