    Small Stiefel manifold

<question>
    Show that the set $$\calM = \{(x, y) \in \Rd \times \Rd \colon x^{\top} x=1, y^{\top}y=1, x^{\top} y=0\}$$ is an embedded submanifold of $\calE = \Rd \times \Rd$.
</question>
<sketch>
    Define a function $h \colon \Rd \times \Rd \to \Rk$ for some $k$ such that $\calM = \{ (x, y) \in \Rd \times \Rd : h(x, y) = 0 \}$, and study the properties of $h$.
    Equivantly, you can also define $h$ over the matrices in $\reals^{d \times 2}$.

    The direct approach is to let $h(x, y) = (x^\top x - 1, y^\top y - 1, x^\top y)$ from $\Rd \times \Rd \to \reals^3$, and to study the rank of the differential of $h$.

    Alternatively, and in a way that more transparently suggests how to proceed to study a general Stiefel manifold, proceed as follows.

    Letting the columns of $X \in \reals^{d \times 2}$ be $x$ and $y$ we can reformulate $\calM$ as,
    \begin{aligned}
        \calM = \{X \in \reals^{d \times 2} : X^\top X = I\}.
    \end{aligned}
    Let
    \begin{aligned}
        h \colon \reals^{d \times 2} \to \Sym(2), \quad \quad h(X) = X^\top X - I,
    \end{aligned}
    where $\Sym(2) := \{U \in \reals^{2 \times 2} \; | \; U=U^\top\}$.
    As $h$ is clearly smooth and $\calM:=h^{-1}(\{0\})$ we only need to show that $\rank \; \D h(X) = \dim(\Sym(2)) = 3$ for all $X \in \calM$.
    This is equivalent to show that $\D h(X)$ is surjective for all $X \in \calM$.
    By a straightforward computation we get that $\D h(X)[V] = X^\top V + V^\top X$ for $X \in \calM$ and $V \in \reals^{d \times 2}$.
    Thus for arbitrary $W \in \Sym(2)$ we have that
    \begin{aligned}
        \D h(X)\bigg[\frac{1}{2} X W\bigg] = \frac{1}{2} (X^\top X W + W^\top X^\top X) = \frac{1}{2}(W + W^\top) = W,
    \end{aligned}
    which shows that $\D h(X)$ is surjective and hence that $\calM$ is a manifold.

<question>
    What are the tangent spaces of $\calM$? What is the dimension of $\calM$?
</question>

    Once the previous question is solved, you have all the ingredients you need.

<answer>
    <p>
    Continue from above.
    </p>
    <p>
    The tangent space to $\calM$ at $X \in \calM$ is given by
    \begin{aligned}
        \T_X \calM = \ker \D h(X) = \{V \in \reals^{d \times 2} : X^\top V + V^\top X = 0\}.
    \end{aligned}
    </p>
    <p>
    By definition, the dimension of $\calM$ is the dimension of any of its tangent space,s hence we have (by the rank-nullity theorem applied to $\D h(X)$) $\dim \calM = \dim(\reals^{d \times 2}) - \dim(\Sym(2)) = 2d-3$.
