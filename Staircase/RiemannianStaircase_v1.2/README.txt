This is Matlab code to solve optimization problems over the cone of
positive semidefinite matrices with diagonal block constraints. The main
tool is optimization on manifolds, which is executed via the Manopt toolbox:

    http://www.manopt.org

Please download the latest version of Manopt on the website.

The best way to get started is to read and run example.m.
It will generate a random instance of a synchronization problem and solve
it in different ways.

Please cite this paper when using the code:
